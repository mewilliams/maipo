### Analyses of Maipo Experiement

_Repository currently public, will become private after I have convinced us this is a good way to collaboratively work and version control_

File structure:

#### Scripts

For processing scripts (grouped by instrument right now)

#### Edited data

Actually this folder doesn't need to be version controlled, it can be local on a machine or hard drive, but scripts will send data there, so the folder is here.

#### Raw data

What it says. Also shouldn't be version controlled (just copied from the google drive), but should contain a markdown (\*.md) file that describes the data that _should_ be there with its location and filename.

#### Images

Also not version control

#### Manuscripts

For latex files, later. 

### Useful related information (about git, etc.)

##### Git

Git is a version control software - essentially it compares two text documents and records changes, so if you break or change something you can go back and fix it, or if you are working collectively on a bit of code one person can change line 5 while the other is working on line 2003, and the code can be merged into one. Github is one of several websites to host your version controls. There is a [GUI](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis/) as well as command line operation with git. A few resources:
